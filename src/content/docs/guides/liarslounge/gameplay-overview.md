## Game Flow Overview

### 1. Joining and Starting
- Players gather in the arena's waiting lobby
- Games start automatically when enough players join
- All players are teleported to seats around the lounge table
- Each player receives their starting hand and the tension begins

### 2. The Round Structure
Each round follows this pattern:
1. **Table Card Reveal**: A target card is shown to all players
2. **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns claiming to play the table card
3. **Accusation Phase**: Any player can call "Liar!" on the previous player
4. **Consequence Phase**: Wrong accusations or lies lead to the axe
5. **Reset**: Survivors get new cards and a new table card is revealed

### 3. Victory Condition
The last player alive wins the game.

## Understanding the Deck

The game uses a carefully balanced deck that creates strategic depth:

:::note[Deck Composition]
**Total: 20 Cards**
- **6 King Cards**
- **6 Queen Cards**
- **6 Ace Cards**
- **2 Joker Cards** - Wild cards that can represent ANY other card
:::

This distribution means that having the table card is statistically likely, but not guaranteed - creating perfect conditions for bluffing.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Your Turn Actions

When it's your turn, you have two primary options:

#### Option 1: Play Cards
1. **Select Cards**: Left-click 1-3 cards in your inventory to select them
2. **Drop Cards**: Press Q (drop key) to play your selected cards
3. **Claim Honesty**: You're claiming these cards match the table card

:::tip[Card Selection]
- Selected cards show "(Selected)" in their name
- You can select/deselect cards by clicking them
- Maximum 3 cards can be played per turn
- The more cards you play, the bolder your claim appears
:::

#### Option 2: Call Out a Liar
- Use the **"Call Liar!"** item in your inventory
- Accuse the previous player of lying about their cards
- This triggers the consequence phase immediately

### The Psychology of Deception

#### When to Lie
- **No Matching Cards**: If you don't have the table card, you must bluff
- **Strategic Deception**: Sometimes lie even when you have the right cards to throw off opponents
- **Bold Bluffs**: Playing multiple cards makes your claim seem more confident

#### When to Call "Liar!"
- **Suspicious Behavior**: Player hesitated or seemed uncertain
- **Statistical Odds**: Too many of one card type have been played
- **Reading Players**: Trust your instincts about player behavior
- **Desperation**: When you're low on hearts and need to take risks

## The Axe - Consequence System

When someone is caught lying or makes a false accusation, they face the axe:

:::danger[The Axe Mechanism]
- Player starts with **6 chances** (hearts)
- Each axe strike removes **1 heart**
- **Random chance** determines if the axe hits or misses
- **Fewer hearts = higher chance** of being struck
- Lose all hearts = permanent elimination
:::

### Survival Strategy
- **Early Game**: Preserve your hearts by playing safely
- **Mid Game**: Take calculated risks to eliminate opponents
- **Late Game**: Every decision becomes critical as the field narrows

## Advanced Gameplay Elements

### Joker Cards Strategy
Jokers are the most powerful cards in the deck:
- **Wild Card Power**: Can represent any other card type
- **Perfect Bluffs**: Always have a "legitimate" play available
- **Strategic Holding**: Save jokers for crucial moments
- **Deception Tool**: Play jokers when you actually have the real card

### Reading the Table
- **Card Counting**: Track what cards have been played
- **Pattern Recognition**: Notice if too many of one type appear
- **Player Behavior**: Watch for tells and nervous behavior
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculate odds based on remaining deck

### Multiplayer Dynamics
- **Target Selection**: Choose your accusations wisely
- **Pressure Application**: Use accusations to force difficult decisions
- **Endgame Politics**: Final players often face the hardest choices
